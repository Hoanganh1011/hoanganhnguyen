A fifth member, Yeri, joined the group in March 2015, following the release of their first mini album, Ice Cream Cake. Musically, the work of Red Velvet reflects their own group name: their predominantly-pop "red" side experiments occasionally with electronic, funk and hip hop, while their "velvet" side focuses on '90s-influenced RB with elements of ballad and jazz. Their genre versatility and hooks have garnered critical praise.</p></li>

Numerous others charted both in the Gaon Album Chart and the Billboard World Digital Song Sales including "Happiness", "Ice Cream Cake", "Dumb Dumb", "One of These Nights", "Russian Roulette", "Rookie", "Peek-a-Boo", "Bad Boy", "RBB (Really Bad Boy)", "Zimzalabim", "Umpah Umpah", "Psycho", and "Queendom". The group also ventured into the Japanese music scene with the extended plays #Cookie Jar (2018) and Sappy (2019).</p></li>
			<li><p>Red Velvet have received numerous accolades, most notably the Golden Disc New Artist Award, the Mnet Asian Music Award for Best Female Group, the Korean Music Award for Best Pop Song, and the Asia Artist Award for Song of the Year.
